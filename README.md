OxyTech ‚Äì Smart Oxygen Cylinder Control System

OxyTech is a smart, IoT-based oxygen cylinder control and monitoring system designed to improve medical oxygen management through automation, real-time analytics, and remote access.

üîß Project Abstract

OxyTech integrates sensor-based flow control, microcontroller automation, and cloud-connected platforms to monitor and manage oxygen cylinders efficiently. Built around a Raspberry Pi and connected sensors, the system allows precise oxygen flow regulation and real-time data collection.

The project features:

Sensor-Driven Flow Control: Uses pressure and flow sensors to detect and adjust the oxygen output automatically.

Microcontroller & Raspberry Pi Integration: Handles real-time data processing and decision-making logic for controlling valves and alarms.

Mobile Application (Flutter): Allows users (e.g., healthcare workers, technicians) to monitor cylinder status, receive alerts, and view analytics on the go.

Web Dashboard (React.js): A comprehensive dashboard for administrators and hospitals to visualize multiple cylinder units, historical data, alerts, and usage patterns.

üí° Key Features

Real-time monitoring of oxygen pressure, flow rate, and remaining capacity.

Automated alerts for low pressure or abnormal flow conditions.

Mobile app for field monitoring and patient-side usage.

Web dashboard for centralized control and analytics.

Scalable architecture for managing multiple oxygen units.
